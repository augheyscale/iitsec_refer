Its appeal is strongest for technical researchers and mid-career practitioners focused on AI, HMT, and low-SWaP edge deployment; it is less tailored to operators or policy audiences. Accessibility is moderate-to-high for technical readers, though broader acquisition and leadership stakeholders may find maturity and benchmarking gaps (latency/power/TRL) that warrant follow-on inquiry."

      "Summary_Assessment": "This paper is an applied Lean Six Sigma case study on improving training organization performance—streamlining processes, boosting first-pass certification rates, and reducing cost per learner—using familiar quality tools with clear, quantified results. It is highly accessible (little math, step-by-step methods) and best suited to attendees focused on training operations, onboarding, quality, and continuous improvement across industry and government. It is less compelling for those seeking cutting-edge simulation/AI, interoperability standards, or acquisition policy specifics, but offers strong practical takeaways for optimizing training delivery at scale."

          "Rationale": "Highlights emerging capability patterns for synthetic training adversaries and decision-support wargames, useful for long-term planning and vendor evaluation. TRL is early and the domain is a surrogate (Catan), so near-term acquisition impact is limited."

      ],
      "Summary_Assessment": "This paper is a strong fit for research- and innovation-minded attendees: it presents advanced multi-agent RL methods, graph-based state modeling, and a practical ensemble approach validated in a complex turn-based environment. While the Catan testbed is a surrogate, the results translate to training adversary design, red-teaming, and decision-support wargames. Accessibility is moderate to low for non-technical audiences; the greatest value accrues to academics, technical leads, and innovators seeking actionable techniques and open-source starting points rather than immediate acquisition-ready solutions."
