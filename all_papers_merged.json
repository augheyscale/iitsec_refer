It offers concrete steps (decomposition, interface standardization, refactoring), standards alignment (DIS/HLA), configuration/asset management structures, validation methods, and measurable sustainment benefits. The paper will resonate most with mid-career technical leads and government acquisition/program staff, while also providing strategic takeaways for executives and small businesses, interoperability relevance for international delegates, and practice-to-theory value for academics. It is not introductory; attendees seeking hands-on modernization guidance and standards-based integration will gain the most."

      "Summary_Assessment": "This is an applied-to-advanced paper integrating a mixed-reality cockpit with EW/EMSO threat modeling (STK), weapon system analysis (CPE), and data-driven guidance/debrief to improve pilot survivability. It offers clear scenario construction, performance metrics, and Monte Carlo analysis—appealing to technical leaders and researchers, while remaining practical for operators and acquisitions. Accessibility is moderate (requires EW/M&S familiarity), and while cost/TRL/interoperability details are limited, the work fits I/ITSEC’s focus on measurable training effectiveness and integrated, threat-informed simulation."

      ],
      "Summary_Assessment": "This applied case study will strongly appeal to DoD training and medical readiness communities seeking measurable, interoperable approaches to competency-based training across LVC environments. It is technically accessible to practitioners and program managers, yet advanced enough for technical leads and researchers due to its use of TLA/xAPI, GIFT, and multimodal analytics. The multinational Bold Quest context and linkage to METL/CRP make it relevant for strategy, acquisition, and coalition partners, with clear pathways to collaborate, integrate, and operationalize at scale."
